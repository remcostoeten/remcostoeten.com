#personal site. No clue what it's going to be, just freestyle coding and styling whatever I feel like. Build on NextJS with TypeScript. Main purpose is practicing these languages and showcasing my code/git commits style through this repo.

#Site is hosted on <a href="https://remcostoeten.com">www.remcostoeten.com</a>. Obviously still under construction.
